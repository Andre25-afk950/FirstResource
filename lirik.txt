Ambiguously
I’m gonna sleep well tonight
Just happens to be a little just of the night
Funerals are cynical murderous material
For people that you don’t even like
Was it poison in the antidote
Purple in the varicose
Nobody knows how we died

I’m a black veil bride
No one’s falling in love tonight
Keep your distance
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Find me at the scene of the crime

I’m a black veil bride
Running lonely
I got no time
To stroke your ego
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Baby it’s just dead by design
Dead by design

It came from a dream
So you and me afterlife
It’s not what it seems
So don’t get too close tonight
Funerals are cynical murderous material
For people that you don’t even like
Was it poison in the antidote
Purple in the varicose
Nobody knows how we died

I’m a black veil bride
No one’s falling in love tonight
Keep your distance
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Find me at the scene of the crime

I’m a black veil bride
Running lonely
I got no time
To stroke your ego
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Baby it’s just dead by design
Dead by design

A true crime of passion
You just made my alibi
A fatal attraction
I’m just too good
At goodbyes
At goodbyes

I’m a black veil bride
No one’s falling in love tonight
Keep your distance
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Find me at the scene of the crime

I’m a black veil bride
Running lonely
I got no time
To stroke your ego
I’mma hurt somebody
Love somebody
Baby it’s just dead by design
Dead by design
